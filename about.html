                <p class="text-hello">Foods</p>
                <p>I like fried rice, noodles, and grilled chicken. I don't like spicy foods, so i always set aside the hot sauce and sambal when i eat.

                <p class="text-hello">School Subjects</p>
                <p>The subjects that i like the most are Software and Game Development Basics (Dasar - Dasar PPLG) and English. I like them because i understand English well and i can understand these subjects. The subject that i like the least is Mathematics, because it requires lots and lots of counting, which i'm not very good at.

                <p class="text-hello">Manga</p>
                <p>I mostly like reading yuri mangas. Some of my favourites are Yagate Kimi ni Naru and Citrus. I also read shounen mangas sometimes, my favourite being JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and One Piece. I'm currently on my way to finish Watanare (Light novel) and Naruto, so please don't give me any spoilers as it would greatly decrease my enjoyment in reading them. Feel free to chat with me if you have the same interests on mangas as i do.

                <p class="text-hello">Drawings</p>
                <p>I mostly draw on HVS papers. My style is to be as close as possible to the reference. I only use 2B pencils for my drawings, and i don't draw with sketching first, i just draw it right away. My drawings usually take 4 hours minimum, and up to 8 hours max. My drawings never exceed 8 hours because i'm not a hardcore detailed artist unlike others, i just draw because i like it and i enjoyed doing it.
